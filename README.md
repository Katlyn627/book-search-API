## **Description**

Refactor a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API as a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The original app was built using the MERN stack with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. It was already set up to allow users to save book searches to the back end.
